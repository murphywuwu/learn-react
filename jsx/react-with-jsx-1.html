  <!-- 
    Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
    It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of react
    
    Read this section for a production-ready setup with jsx:
    https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project
    
    In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
    https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

    You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
    https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
